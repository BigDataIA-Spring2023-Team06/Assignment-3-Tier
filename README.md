This document presents the design of a service plan that offers a free plan and two premium plans with different limits. The service plan includes a user registration page that allows users to choose their preferred plan, change their password, and store it securely with hashing. Additionally, the enhanced logging feature helps track user activity and compare it with their plan limits. Two dashboards are provided, one for admin/developers/owners and another for individual users, that provide a range of analytics, such as total API calls, success and failure rates, and more. To make the service more accessible, Typer is used to create a CLI with multiple functionalities. Finally, a Python package is created, and an airflow dag is scheduled to update the metadata file.
